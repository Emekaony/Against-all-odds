- Just realized I am actually pretty good at this coding thing oh wtfff
- No matter how much I wanna stop, I can't. I just keep surprizing myself daily.
- How many people are getting better on a daily basis? 
  How many people are actually improving themselves, taking courses against all odds even when defeated by the current eomplyment market.
  I will put in the work necessary to beat all odds. There's no back-up plan
  I will do whatever it takes to win. I must WIN.
- A closure is a variable. The whole idea behind closure is that it can capture its environment.
- Closures capture their environment by accessing variables higher in scope than themselves.
- when a closure mutates a variable, u must declare it as mutable because it implemens fnMut
- fnOnce -> the closure takes ownership of its environment variable
- fnMut -> mutates
- fn -> just gets a reference
