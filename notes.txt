- Just realized I am actually pretty good at this coding thing oh wtfff
- No matter how much I wanna stop, I can't. I just keep surprizing myself daily.
- How many people are getting better on a daily basis? 
  How many people are actually improving themselves, taking courses against all odds even when defeated by the current eomplyment market.
  I will put in the work necessary to beat all odds. There's no back-up plan
  I will do whatever it takes to win. I must WIN.
